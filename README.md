# Install
## OS X
``` 
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere/master/install | bash
```
- Open **System Preferences** and navigate to **keyboard > shortcuts > Services**.
Check the box beside "Emacs Anywhere", click "Add Shortcut" and key a shortcut.

- Add `Script Editor` (`/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app`) to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility**

## Linux
>In order to use **Emacs Anywhere**, you must use **Xorg** as your window manager. You can **switch** your window manager in **Ubuntu** by going to the login screen, clicking the cog icon, and selecting **Xorg**.

### dependencies

### Install
``` 
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere/master/install | bash
```
Create a keyboard shortcut to run `~/.emacs_anywhere/bin/run`.

## Windows
TBD

# Usage
## Try It
1. Make sure your Emacs server is running. You can start the server like this
```
emacs --daemon
```
2. Focus an application window's text input. A text area in your browser will do.
3. Key the keyboard shortcut you've chosen for **Emacs Anywhere** 
4. Write some text
5. Delete the frame (`C-x 5 0`, or `:q` if you use evil-mode).
**Emacs Anywhere** will copy the text from the buffer "\*Emacs Anywhere\*" to clipboard, delete the
buffer, switch focus to the window from step two and paste the buffers content into the text input.

## Environment
The `EA_EDITOR` environment variable can be used to override the way
**emacsclient** is run. For example, you could put the following statement into
your `.bash_profile`.
```
export EA_EDITOR='emacsclient -a "" -c'
```
With the environment variable set, the invocation will look like this under the
hood
```
emacsclient -a "" -c -e <elisp code>
```
You can prefix **emacsclient** with it's path if **Emacs Anywhere** can't find
it in your `PATH` environment variable.

## Hooks
| Hook              | Function Signature              | Description                                               |
| ----              | ------------------              | -----------                                               |
| **ea-popup-hook** | (app-name window-title x y w h) | Functions run after an **Emacs Anywhere** session starts. |

## Examples
```elisp
;; Define a function or use a lambda of the same signature
(defun popup-handler (app-name window-title x y w h)
  ;; do stuff
  )

;; Hook your function
(add-hook 'ea-popup-hook 'popup-handler)
```
In your hook function you can do things like set the major mode based on the
application name or window title...
```elisp
(defun github-conversation-p (window-title)
  (or (string-match-p "Pull Request" window-title)
      (string-match-p "Issue" window-title)
      ;; ...
      ))

(defun popup-handler (app-name window-title x y w h)
  ;; set major mode
  (cond
    ((github-conversation-p window-title) (gfm-mode))
    ;; ...
    (t (markdown-mode)) ; default major mode
    ))
```
...or set the frame size and position to fit the bottom 400px of the window...
```elisp
(defun popup-handler (app-name window-title x y w h)
  (set-frame-position (selected-frame) x (+ y (- h 400)))
  (unless (zerop w)
    (set-frame-size (selected-frame) w 400 t))
  ;; ...
  )
```
...or configure automation settings
```elisp
(defun popup-handler (app-name window-title x y w h)
  (when (equal app-name "Terminal")
    ;; Tell Emacs Anywhere not to paste if launched from Terminal
    (setq ea-paste nil))
  ;; ...
  )
```
